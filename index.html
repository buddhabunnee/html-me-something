<h3>
Once Upon a Time..
</h3>
<p>
The year was 2005. I was 20 years old, working as a part-time Chinese delivery driver while attending Saint Louis University. Not many knew, but I was living a double life. When I was not working or studying, I was completely immersed in a virtual world - playing an online game called Final Fantasy XI. In this world, I was a chibi elf-like character named Skylar. She had the ability to summon ancient gods to do her bidding, she could heal her allies with powerful magic spells, and unleash devastating blows to enemies with ranged attacks. <a href="http://launchcode.org" alt="new">Oh,cd c;cd and here's a link to Launchcode's website.</a>

<h3>
Summer Love 2005
</h3>
<p>
Lots of friends were made during my time on the Asura server. I started chatting with one of these friends with increasing frequency, and eventually we started to talk on the phone. He played a mage and we had many fun adventures in game and were in the same end-game guild. We enjoyed talking about the game, but we also started to learn about each other outside of the game context. Eventually, we decided to meet IRL. I booked a flight to his hometown of Camrose, Alberta.

In Canada, Milk Comes in Bags
</h3>
<p>
Meeting my friend for the first time at the Edmonton airport was one of the most exciting feelings I've ever experienced. I enjoyed noting the differences between Canada and my home country.<br><br>A Few Differences Include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Metric System</li>
<li>Colorful Paper Money</li>
<li>Loonies ($1 coin)</li>
<li>Toonies ($2 coin)</li>
<li>Funny Northern accents</li>
<li>Lots of French stuff</li>
<li>Ridiculous levels of COLD</li>
</ul>

<h3>
A Year Up North
</h3>
<p>
I ended up getting an apartment with the guy and lived in Canada for most of 2006. Since I was not a citizen, I could not work. This made for a rather boring life. Eventually I became homesick and wanted to return to Missouri and return to school. We ended our relationship on good terms and decided to stay long-distance friends. When I got home, I returned to school and eventually quit playing the game. Several years later, I got the next FF online game, FFXIV, and still play that casually to this day.
